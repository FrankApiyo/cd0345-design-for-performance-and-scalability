"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services.",,,,,,,,,

Rationale (Which services changed?) The number of Application and web server instances have been reduced from 8 to 4. This still allows for redundancy and HA but lowers cost,,,,,,,,,
